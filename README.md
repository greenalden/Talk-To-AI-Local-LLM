The vision and purpose of this


  My vision was to make an AI voice assistant that you would ask questions to, just like Google and Alexa, but this has 2 advantages. First, you have control over the name of the AI, including the wake word. Secondly and more importantly it is entirely on machine after setup,
  this would mean that your data is private.

This is a work on progress for the setup, as of now this only works on Windows and uses just over 11gb of VRAM and 16gb RAM. Just run the SetupAll.bat then the Run.bat and you should be set.
