The vision and purpose of this
  My vision was to make an AI voice assistant that you would ask questions to, just like Google and Alexa, but this has 2 advantages. First, you have control over the name of the AI, including the wake word. Secondly and more importantly it is entirely on machine after setup,
  this would mean that your data is private.

This is in a very early state and is not a user-friendly setup process. So at this time, I am not providing any setup instructions, though if anyone wants to go through the effort of setting it up I would be happy to answer any questions.
